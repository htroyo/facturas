This is a small project for databases 2 course using php and mongodb, this small application shows also jquery in action.
The application' main objective was to demostrate non-relational DBMSs in  web applications. All studentsmust complete the project in less than a week so i focused on implementing all required funcionality so i didn't implement a sophisticated error handling and data validation.

INSTALLATION:
This application was developed in 2013 using mongodb 2.4 and php 5 (older than 5.6) but it still works on php 5.6 and mongodb 3.2, but you need the old mongodb driver (mongo 1.5) in order to run the application. After setting up the environment just copy the files to your web server.
In MongoDB create a database called "facturas" and import the "datos.json" file into a collection called "datos".
That's all, the application is ready to run.
